# Sentiment Analysis on Kozmos Customer Reviews

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **sentiment analysis** for Kozmos, a company selling home textiles and casual wear on Amazon. The main goal is to analyze customer reviews to identify recurring complaints and make data-driven decisions to improve products. By performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews, we can categorize feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps in understanding customer satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement.

In this notebook, we leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to build a **classification model** that automatically classifies the sentiment of reviews, supporting Kozmos in improving its product offerings.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 5611 customer reviews and has four features:
- **Star**: Number of stars given to the product (1 to 5).
- **Helpful**: The number of people who found the review helpful.
- **Title**: The title or short description of the review.
- **Review**: The full content of the customer review.

The dataset size is 489 KB and contains valuable insights for sentiment analysis. 

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and tokenizing reviews.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of star ratings, the most common words in reviews, and other relevant insights.
   
3. **Sentiment Tagging**:
   - Assigning sentiment labels to reviews (positive, neutral, negative) based on star ratings and review content.
   
4. **Text Vectorization**:
   - Using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings to convert text data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
   
5. **Model Building**:
   - Building and training a classification model (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Deep Learning models) to predict the sentiment of customer reviews.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
- `nltk`
- `tensorflow` or `keras` (optional, depending on the model used)

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-kozmos.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells in sequence:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis_kozmos.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The sentiment analysis model can accurately categorize customer reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories, helping Kozmos understand customer feedback more effectively and take action to improve product quality.

## Future Work

- **Further Model Improvement**: Experiment with advanced models like BERT for better accuracy in classifying sentiments.
- **Additional Feature Engineering**: Incorporate more features (such as review length or helpfulness) into the model.
- **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate the model into a real-time application that continuously analyzes incoming reviews.

## Conclusion

This project provides Kozmos with a powerful tool to analyze customer sentiment, offering actionable insights that can drive product improvement and customer satisfaction.
